------- Obstacles -------
1. User Authentication

At first, I used Auth0 for this feature, but soon I relized that it was a bit complicated when the rest of my project using Amazon services.

Solution: I switched to AWS Cognito.

2. AWS S3 and Cloudfront

- I set up 2 buckets for input and output videos. However, I had a problem when setting up Cloudfront Distribution. 
It couldn't access to the output bucket to get the decrypted files. Also, I couldn't grant the user access to the output even though it's public.

Solution: I decided to put all decrypted files in the input buckets but in a different folder.

- There are so many keys,ids and documents that made me confused. Also, I wasn't clear how S3 and Cloudfront works together

Solution: I went with a basic tutorial on AWS page, then I added new Bucket Policy and CORS Configuration. This took most of my time to figure it out.

3. AWS Cognito

I couldn't find any tokens that identify a group of users to set permission.

Solution: I grouped users and set role for that group. So, based on the group name, I would allow users to play videos.
